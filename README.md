In this  we will do small image classification using CIFAR10 dataset in tensorflow. We will use convolutional neural network for this image classification problem. First we will train a model using simple artificial neural network and then check how the performance looks like and then we will train a CNN and see how the model accuracy improves. This  will help in  understanding why CNN is preferred over ANN for image classification.
